<p>On Wednesday at 6pm we have our monthly Student Tech Meetup as well as our Annual General Meeting.
Mark yourself as going <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/408493869580985/?ref=46">on Facebook</a> so we have enough food for you, and drop us a message if you have any special requirements.
</p>

<p>
We have a good number of people running for election, so once you've <a href="/elections">reviewed the various positions</a>, take a look at who is running for election!
</p>
<p>
  If you haven't submitted a manifesto and would still like to run for election, please read <a href="/elections">the elections page</a>.
</p>

<table>
{% for role in page.roles %}

<tr><td colspan=2><strong>{{ role.title }}</strong></td></tr>

{% for person in role.people %}

<tr>
  <td>{{ person.name }} {% if person.url %}</td>
  <td>
    <a href="{{ person.url }}" target=_blank class="btn btn-info btn-sm">view manifesto</a>{% endif %}
  </td>
</tr>

{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
</table>

<br>
<p>
  We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect tomorrow â€” please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for Ron (reopen nominations) for all positions.
</p>
<p>
  Election candidates - please remember that if you are running for President, VP, Secretary or Treasurer, your speech may be up to 2 minutes. Other roles have up to 1 minute. If you haven't bought membership yet, do that now.
</p>

<p>See you tomorrow,</p>

<p>CompSoc &lt;3 You!</p>
