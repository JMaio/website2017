At [last night's EGM](https://www.facebook.com/events/2191698291111220/) we had to elect [some new committee members](https://comp-soc.com/blog/2018/10/05/october-egm.html)! 


Our new office bearers are:

- Secretary: Mo Javad
- Technical Secretary: Patrick Kage
- Social Secretary: Tony Duggan
- 1st Year Rep: Kyle Cotton

As requested by one of the candidates, here are the breakdowns of votes for each position:

- Secretary
  - Total votes: 63
  - Bora Mert Alper: 14
  - Mo Javad: 49
- Technical Secretary
  - Total votes: 61
  - Ege Elgun: 13
  - Patrick Kage: 42
  - Samuel Macleod: 6
- Social Secretary:
  - Total votes: 55
  - Ron: 7
  - Azam Khan: 18
  - Raman Goyal: 9
  - Tony Duggan: 21
- 1st Year Rep:
  - Total Votes: 47
  - Ron: 4
  - Kyle Cotton: 21
  - Jack Watt: 4
  - Lorenzo Baldini: 18

For all of the votes Ron was an option (reopen nominations), however he sadly did not win any positions and didn't even get any votes for Secretary or Tech Sec. There were 2 bad votes, one for social secretary where the number was unrecognisable and another where it was unclear which position the slip was for.
