So you're interested in learning more about the field of Informatics? We support some amazing initiatives that can help build your knowledge, no matter your skill level.


### [CompSoc Library](/library)

We have many books, and many of these books are suitable for courses taken throughout your degree.

### [Programming Club](https://progclub.inf.ed.ac.uk)

This is where you can work on various projects. Aimed at first and second year students, but available to everyone.

### Learning how to code

Becoming a programmer isn't something that can just be taught: you need to put a lot of your own personal time into it.

There are plenty of places where you can get help, and in addition to the Cascaders Evenings, we're happy to answer any questions you have [online](/community).

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) has some excellent free courses for learning how to code. Great languages to start out with would be Python or JavaScript.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) another great free resource with tutorials and reference materials for both frontend, and backend web development.
- [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/61oly8/new_read_me_first/) - a community on reddit
- ["Become a Programmer"](https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Developer/become-a-programmer) - this is a Lynda course (you have a free membership through myEd)

Even if you're a complete beginner you should come along to a couple of our events. We cover the wide range of Informatics and surrounding yourself with likeminded people is a great way to boost your interest in becoming a programmer. More resources to be added here soon...

### Better Informatics

Better Informatics is an academic website run by the students, supported by students, for the students. We have resources for almost every Informatics course, and it's up to you to support other people on the same course as you. [Visit the website.](https://betterinformatics.com)

Even if you don't study a course in The School of Informatics, many of the resources here are still useful.
